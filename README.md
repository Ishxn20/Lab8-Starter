Graceful degradation is a strategy for designing web applications to ensure that they provide the best possible experience using the latest technologies, while still maintaining essential functionality on older or less capable platforms. Service workers play a crucial role in this strategy by enabling web applications to function offline or under poor network conditions. They do this by intercepting network requests and serving cached responses when the network is unavailable or slow. This ensures that users can continue to access and interact with the application, thereby enhancing the application's resilience and performance and adhering to the principles of graceful degradation.
